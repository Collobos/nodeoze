Imagine if you would the C++ standards committee and the boys and girls from Joyent (creators of node.js) all got drunk at a bar and together they spawned a new creation.

So many questions...what would it look like? How would it work? Do they all have a drinking problem?

We can't answer these questions. But what we can do is tell you about nodeoze, a c++ networking library that takes as it's inspiration many of the concepts introduced by Node.js.

Networking in C++ doesn't have to be hard. Matter of fact, it can be downright fun.  If you're using nodeoze that is.
